Project Name: Flask CRUD Application
Overview
This project is a web application built using the Flask framework and MongoDB for database operations. The application demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through a web interface. It includes routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in a MongoDB collection.

Features
Create: Add new records to the database.
Read: Retrieve and display all records from the database.
Update: Edit and update existing records.
Delete: Remove records from the database.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Flask
MongoDB
pymongo
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-crud-app.git
cd flask-crud-app
Set up a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:
